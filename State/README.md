# State 01

Create a Counter class component with an internal state containing a count property, initialized to 0. The Counter component should render the count property within an h1 tag, and the count property should be incremented by 1 every second;

# State 03

Modify the Counter component so that the initial value of the counter, the increment interval and the increment amount are passed as props to the component.

# State 04

Extract the h1 tag showing the count state variable into a new component called CounterDisplay and render it within the Counter component, passing it the count state variable as a prop.
